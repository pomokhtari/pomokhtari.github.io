<h3>What I'm Busy with <h3>

<h3>I'm trying to make a markdown parser in pure C</h3>
<p>Ok this one was decided when I finished my C Tutorial and thought: "You
don't know shit about a programming language until you do a real project in it!"
and so started the adventure...

P.S.: I've already looked at some of the existing markdown parsers. I Don't have a
clue how they work or if a good parser in pure C already exists, just trying to
get my hands dirty my own way.</p>

<hr>
<p>these days you can't find websites as simple and elegent as this one! shame
