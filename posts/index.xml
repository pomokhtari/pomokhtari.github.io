      <description>This is a guide to get started with a comfortable workspace that helps you focus (mostly) on your code and the learning curve of development with Go. This is not at all a professional&amp;rsquo;s guide, it&amp;rsquo;s merely to be used as a way to avoid the confusions of conventions and the Go way of doing things and get started dealing with the actual programming concepts.
Update: I would like to thank people over at Reddit for pointing out a couple of obsolete tools recommended in this post.</description>
