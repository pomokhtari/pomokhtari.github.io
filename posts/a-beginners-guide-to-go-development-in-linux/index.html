    <h1 class="title">A Beginners Guide to Go Development in Linux</h1>
    
    <div class="content">
      <p>This is a guide to get started with a comfortable workspace that helps you focus (mostly) on your code and the learning curve of development with Go. This is not at all a professional&rsquo;s guide, it&rsquo;s merely to be used as a way to avoid the confusions of conventions and the Go way of doing things and get started dealing with the actual programming concepts.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: I would like to thank people over at Reddit for pointing out a couple of obsolete tools recommended in this post. Thanks Chiodood, tv64738.</p>
<p>You will need some basic terminal knowledge to use this. Also you need to have Go installed on your system. If you don&rsquo;t have Go installed <a href="https://golang.org/doc/install">You should read here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="packages">Packages</h3>
<p>In Go, software is stored as packages. Packages are actually just a bunch of source files defining stuff. Packages might use other packages as dependencies. Your program, being a package, has it&rsquo;s source files and dependencies too.</p>
<h3 id="modules">Modules</h3>
<p>Newer tools and compilers (&gt;=1.11) Introduce modules that can be used as a dependency management system and a way to organize code. A module includes one or more packages. It uses a file called <code>go.mod</code> to define the paths to your packages as well as other required packages. It is a nice way of doing things. So if you&rsquo;re using a newer version (which you should) you should learn to use it.</p>
<p>To initialize a new module run something like this in a project directory outside your GOPATH:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">
go mod init gitlab.com/example/project

</code></pre></div><p>This makes a new go.mod file in the current directory. Go modules are still evolving. We will talk a bit about dependency management with modules later on.</p>
<p>Note: All your code should always be in either inside a module or <code>GOPATH</code>. Do not put Go code anywhere else.</p>
<h3 id="gopath">GOPATH</h3>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <code>GOPATH</code> is the old way of keeping packages. The new module system should be used instead for a better management of source code.  Some projects still use it though so If you&rsquo;re curious about how things used to be, or should the need arise to work with one of these packages you might want to continue reading. Otherwise, it&rsquo;s OK to just skip this section and jump to &ldquo;Compiler&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Go used to store all files in <code>GOPATH</code>. A directory containing source code and possibly binary form of packages. It typically defaults to a directory named <code>go</code> inside your home directory. You can change this path.</p>
<p>The recommended way is to export an environmental variable <code>GOPATH</code>. the <code>go</code> tool, holds this variable. You can view or change it using the following commands:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">
go env GOPATH <span style="color:#75715e"># view the current GOPATH</span>

go env -w GOPATH<span style="color:#f92672">=</span>$HOME/my/favorite/path <span style="color:#75715e"># change it</span>

</code></pre></div><p>To make your shell aware of this variable you must enter the following in your <code>.bashrc</code>/<code>.zshrc</code>/etc. as well:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">
export GOPATH<span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">$(</span>go env GOPATH<span style="color:#66d9ef">)</span>

	<span style="color:#e6db74">```</span>

	GOPATH contains multiple directories. For example code goes in the <span style="color:#e6db74">`</span>src<span style="color:#e6db74">`</span> directory <span style="color:#66d9ef">while</span> binary builds go in <span style="color:#e6db74">`</span>bin<span style="color:#e6db74">`</span>. Also there is <span style="color:#e6db74">`</span>pkg<span style="color:#e6db74">`</span> that contains compiled bits of your source code. But don<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;t get yourself concerned over these. They will be created automatically if necessary. However, you might want to add `bin` to your PATH at some point:
</span><span style="color:#e6db74">
</span><span style="color:#e6db74">	```bash
</span><span style="color:#e6db74">
</span><span style="color:#e6db74">	export PATH=$(go env GOPATH)/bin:$PATH
</span><span style="color:#e6db74">
</span><span style="color:#e6db74">	```
</span><span style="color:#e6db74">
</span><span style="color:#e6db74">### Compiler
</span><span style="color:#e6db74">
</span><span style="color:#e6db74">	I don&#39;</span>t recommend using gccgo. The <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;official&#34;</span> Go compiler offers several tools that are considered mainstream in the community. I would also suggest avoiding an old compiler like the ones shipped with Debian or any other frozen GNU/Linux distribution.

	Once you start to get the hang of it you can use whatever makes you happy though.

<span style="color:#75715e">### Storing Your Project</span>

	It is also customary and maybe even expected to put all your <span style="color:#e6db74">`</span>.go<span style="color:#e6db74">`</span> source code files in the root directory of your project. If you<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;re using go modules, you can put your project directory anywhere you want. Just make sure that it includes a `go.mod` file and your source code.
</span><span style="color:#e6db74">
</span><span style="color:#e6db74">	However if one uses `GOPATH`, one&#39;</span>s project should rest at <span style="color:#e6db74">`</span>$GOPATH/src<span style="color:#e6db74">`</span>, in it<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;s own directory. If you&#39;</span>re using a version control system and a remote storage <span style="color:#66d9ef">for</span> your code things might get a little different. For example, <span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> you use gitlab.com, you should store your project this way:

	<span style="color:#e6db74">```</span>

	$GOPATH/src/gitlab.com/username/projectname/

	<span style="color:#e6db74">```</span>

	This is a convention because it makes importing and referencing downloaded packages easier.

<span style="color:#75715e">### go get</span>

	A utility to use <span style="color:#66d9ef">for</span> fetching Go packages. You give it an address, it clones the repository at that address , puts it in <span style="color:#e6db74">`</span>$GOPATH/src<span style="color:#e6db74">`</span> builds it and <span style="color:#66d9ef">then</span> puts the resulting binary file in <span style="color:#e6db74">`</span>$GOPATH/bin<span style="color:#e6db74">`</span>. If that package has dependencies, it will <span style="color:#66d9ef">do</span> this <span style="color:#66d9ef">for</span> them as well.

<span style="color:#75715e">### Dependencies</span>

	<span style="color:#e6db74">`</span>go get<span style="color:#e6db74">`</span> does try to handle dependencies, But it is far from perfect. Go modules handles your dependencies as well. All you have to <span style="color:#66d9ef">do</span> is to set it up. And start importing new packages in the source code. Then run <span style="color:#e6db74">`</span>go build<span style="color:#e6db74">`</span> or <span style="color:#e6db74">`</span>go install<span style="color:#e6db74">`</span> to have Go modules fetch all the required packages <span style="color:#66d9ef">for</span> you and <span style="color:#66d9ef">do</span> the requested operation <span style="color:#f92672">(</span>building or installing<span style="color:#f92672">)</span>.

	If you are using <span style="color:#e6db74">`</span>GOPATH<span style="color:#e6db74">`</span> you might want to try <span style="color:#f92672">[</span>dep<span style="color:#f92672">](</span>https://golang.github.io/dep/<span style="color:#f92672">)</span>. It<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;s got it&#39;</span>s share of problems but overall, it works as expected.

<span style="color:#75715e">### Building</span>

	It<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;s easy. Just navigate to a package directory and run `go build`. It takes all .go source files in the current directory and all dependencies, compiles them, links the resulting files and outputs a binary named after the directory containing the package. There is no difference when building a dep managed project.
</span><span style="color:#e6db74">
</span><span style="color:#e6db74">## Installation
</span><span style="color:#e6db74">
</span><span style="color:#e6db74">	run `go install` to make a binary and put it in your `bin` directory. If you add this to `PATH`, you can use the built executable like an installed package.
</span><span style="color:#e6db74">
</span><span style="color:#e6db74">### Conclusion
</span><span style="color:#e6db74">
</span><span style="color:#e6db74">	Hopefully, this guide is enough to get you started if you come from a C or Python background. The rest is up to you. You can always read further into documentations of packages and Go itself to learn more about the standard workflow.
