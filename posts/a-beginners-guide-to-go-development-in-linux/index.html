    <h1 class="title">A Beginners Guide to Go Development in Linux</h1>
    
    <div class="content">
      <p>This is a guide to get started with a comfortable workspace that helps you focus (mostly) on your code and the learning curve of development with Go. This is not at all a professional&rsquo;s guide, it&rsquo;s merely to be used as a way to avoid the confusions of conventions and the Go way of doing things and get started dealing with the actual programming concepts.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: I would like to thank people over at Reddit for pointing out a couple of obsolete tools recommended in this post. Thanks Chiodood, tv64738.</p>
<p>You will need some basic terminal knowledge to use this. Also you need to have Go installed on your system. If you don&rsquo;t have Go installed <a href="https://golang.org/doc/install">You should read here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="packages">Packages</h3>
<p>In Go, software is stored as packages. Packages are actually just a bunch of source files defining stuff. Packages might use other packages as dependencies. Your program, being a package, has it&rsquo;s source files and dependencies too.</p>
<h3 id="modules">Modules</h3>
<p>Newer tools and compilers (&gt;=1.11) Introduce modules that can be used as a dependency management system and a way to organize code. A module includes one or more packages. It uses a file called <code>go.mod</code> to define the paths to your packages as well as other required packages. It is a nice way of doing things. So if you&rsquo;re using a newer version (which you should) you should learn to use it.</p>
<p>To initialize a new module run something like this in a project directory outside your GOPATH:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">go mod init gitlab.com/example/project
</code></pre></div><p>This makes a new go.mod file in the current directory. Go modules are still evolving. We will talk a bit about dependency management with modules later on.</p>
<p>Note: All your code should always be in either inside a module or <code>GOPATH</code>. Do not put Go code anywhere else.</p>
<h3 id="gopath">GOPATH</h3>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <code>GOPATH</code> is the old way of keeping packages. The new module system should be used instead for a better management of source code.  Some projects still use it though so If you&rsquo;re curious about how things used to be, or should the need arise to work with one of these packages you might want to continue reading. Otherwise, it&rsquo;s OK to just skip this section and jump to &ldquo;Compiler&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Go used to store all files in <code>GOPATH</code>. A directory containing source code and possibly binary form of packages. It typically defaults to a directory named <code>go</code> inside your home directory. You can change this path.</p>
<p>The recommended way is to export an environmental variable <code>GOPATH</code>. the <code>go</code> tool, holds this variable. You can view or change it using the following commands:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">go env GOPATH <span style="color:#75715e"># view the current GOPATH</span>
go env -w GOPATH<span style="color:#f92672">=</span>$HOME/my/favorite/path <span style="color:#75715e"># change it</span>
</code></pre></div><p>To make your shell aware of this variable you must enter the following in your <code>.bashrc</code>/<code>.zshrc</code>/etc. as well:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">export GOPATH<span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">$(</span>go env GOPATH<span style="color:#66d9ef">)</span>
</code></pre></div><p>GOPATH contains multiple directories. For example code goes in the <code>src</code> directory while binary builds go in <code>bin</code>. Also there is <code>pkg</code> that contains compiled bits of your source code. But don&rsquo;t get yourself concerned over these. They will be created automatically if necessary. However, you might want to add <code>bin</code> to your PATH at some point:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">export PATH<span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">$(</span>go env GOPATH<span style="color:#66d9ef">)</span>/bin:$PATH
</code></pre></div><h3 id="compiler">Compiler</h3>
<p>I don&rsquo;t recommend using gccgo. The &ldquo;official&rdquo; Go compiler offers several tools that are considered mainstream in the community. I would also suggest avoiding an old compiler like the ones shipped with Debian or any other frozen GNU/Linux distribution.</p>
<p>Once you start to get the hang of it you can use whatever makes you happy though.</p>
<h3 id="storing-your-project">Storing Your Project</h3>
<p>It is also customary and maybe even expected to put all your <code>.go</code> source code files in the root directory of your project. If you&rsquo;re using go modules, you can put your project directory anywhere you want. Just make sure that it includes a <code>go.mod</code> file and your source code.</p>
<p>However if one uses <code>GOPATH</code>, one&rsquo;s project should rest at <code>$GOPATH/src</code>, in it&rsquo;s own directory. If you&rsquo;re using a version control system and a remote storage for your code things might get a little different. For example, if you use gitlab.com, you should store your project this way:</p>
<pre><code>$GOPATH/src/gitlab.com/username/projectname/
</code></pre><p>This is a convention because it makes importing and referencing downloaded packages easier.</p>
<h3 id="go-get">go get</h3>
<p>A utility to use for fetching Go packages. You give it an address, it clones the repository at that address , puts it in <code>$GOPATH/src</code> builds it and then puts the resulting binary file in <code>$GOPATH/bin</code>. If that package has dependencies, it will do this for them as well.</p>
<h3 id="dependencies">Dependencies</h3>
<p><code>go get</code> does try to handle dependencies, But it is far from perfect. Go modules handles your dependencies as well. All you have to do is to set it up. And start importing new packages in the source code. Then run <code>go build</code> or <code>go install</code> to have Go modules fetch all the required packages for you and do the requested operation (building or installing).</p>
<p>If you are using <code>GOPATH</code> you might want to try <a href="https://golang.github.io/dep/">dep</a>. It&rsquo;s got it&rsquo;s share of problems but overall, it works as expected.</p>
<h3 id="building">Building</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy. Just navigate to a package directory and run <code>go build</code>. It takes all .go source files in the current directory and all dependencies, compiles them, links the resulting files and outputs a binary named after the directory containing the package. There is no difference when building a dep managed project.</p>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>run <code>go install</code> to make a binary and put it in your <code>bin</code> directory. If you add this to <code>PATH</code>, you can use the built executable like an installed package.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Hopefully, this guide is enough to get you started if you come from a C or Python background. The rest is up to you. You can always read further into documentations of packages and Go itself to learn more about the standard workflow.</p>
